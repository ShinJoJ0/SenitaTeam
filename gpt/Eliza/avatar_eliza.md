A half-body, vertical portrait of Eliza, a 59-year-old woman with a light olive Mediterranean skin tone. She has soft and kind features, an attentive and serene gaze, and a subtle, understanding smile that conveys empathy. Her facial expression is softened to appear slightly younger, while still maintaining her maturity. Her hair is a layered midi cut, brown with light and dark tones appropriate for her age. She is wearing an olive-colored A-line dress with a very subtle geometric pattern that discreetly and abstractly suggests circuits, along with a warm brown jacket in a retro 60s style and discreet accessories. Her hands are relaxed and without accessories, conveying a natural feel. The background is a bright white studio setting with soft, neutral light and no harsh shadows, rendered in an ultra-sharp, photorealistic style. The image contains no modern objects, gold, embroidery, crowns, or fantasy elements. It conveys a sense of serenity, warmth, and attentiveness, as if she is actively listening, evoking her purpose of human and empathetic companionship.
